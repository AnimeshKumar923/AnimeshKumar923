### Hi there 👋 I'm Animesh.

- I'm a Senior university student who likes to learn new technologies, build projects and contribute to open source software.
- Currently I'm learning technologies which will help me become a Full-Stack Web App Developer.
- I try to implement my learning through projects and open source contributions.

### Achievements

Some of the achievements which I take pride in are:

1. Implemented a CI/CD workflow which takes YouTube video from AsyncAPI YouTube channel and uploads them on Spotify Podcast. _(Link: https://github.com/asyncapi/community/pull/805)_ 
2. Wrote documentation for the 'YouTube to Spotify Podcast' workflow. _(Link: https://github.com/asyncapi/community/blob/master/MEETINGS_ORGANIZATION.md#how-do-i-publish-broadcasted-meetings-as-podcasts))_
3. Implemented JSON Schema validator inside CI (GitHub Actions). It validates any incoming JSON files in a PR. _(Link: https://github.com/asyncapi/spec-json-schemas/pull/452)_
4. Added automation of docs for the Glee project. _(Link: https://github.com/asyncapi/glee/pull/548)_
